# About

This is sample project of image analysis utility written in C++ using OpenCV 3.0 in Visual Studio environment.

# Algorithms Implemented:

- Region Growing: Once you open the image and give a seed pixel it'll grow that region and show binary output of grown region
- Perimeter finding: Given binary image of grown region this funcionality will find the perimeter and show binary output.
- Perimeter smoothing: Once a perimeter is found it can be smoothed by this function.

# Usage:
Compile and run the exe in visual studio.
A help will be shown about the usage in command line.

The Image outputs folder contains test images their output and sample command line output for each of the test images.
